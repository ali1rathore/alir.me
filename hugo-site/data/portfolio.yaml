  description: "When a logistics company across Southeast Asia needed to manage 700+ vehicles in real-time, we didn't just track GPS dots. We built predictive AI that anticipates maintenance needs, optimizes routes based on traffic patterns, and detects fuel theft before it impacts the bottom line. Result: 40% cost reduction in the first year."

  description: "Leading a team of six engineers, I architected the brain of an autonomous hamburger-making robot. This wasn't just automation—it was coordinating dozens of sensors, motors, and control systems to maintain food safety standards while matching human speed. The system now runs at 85% automation with AI handling quality control in real-time."

  description: "A Fortune 500 company was drowning in 10 million documents across legacy systems. We built a RAG system that doesn't just search—it understands context, surfaces insights, and learns from user interactions. Query response times dropped 60% while accuracy improved dramatically. Their knowledge workers now spend time analyzing, not searching."
